    <h2 class="text-h3">How to take care of your new art!</h2>
    <h3 class="text-h5 mb-6">This is my recommendation.</h3>
    <v-container class="text-left">
      <h4 class="text-h4 font-weight-bold">STEP ONE:</h4>
      <p class="mb-8">Leave your tattoo wrapped for at least 1-2 hours. You can leave it wrapped longer, but no more than 6 hours.</p>

      <h4 class="text-h4 font-weight-bold">STEP TWO:</h4>
      <p><strong>CLEAN</strong> - Once you unwrap it, you need to clean it. I recommend cleaning your tattoo with hot water and unscented or antibacterial soap. Lightly soap and rinsing away any blood or plasma - NO SCRUBBING.</p>
      <p>- Try to avoid putting clothing over it immediately, if you can.</p>
      <p>- Now that it's clean, let the tattoo either air dry or lightly dab it with a clean paper towel until dry.</p>
      <p class="mb-8">- Keep your tattoo clean, in general. Clean your tattoo 3-4 times a day as needed, as it will seep for the first few days - this is TOTALLY NORMAL.</p>

      <h4 class="text-h4 font-weight-bold">STEP THREE:</h4>
      <p><strong>MOISTURIZE</strong> - After that first day, continue to keep your tattoo clean, then start using a little bit of unscented lotion (Jergens Ultra Healing, Cetaphil, Aveeno, etc-anything unscented) 2-3 times a day. A little goes a long way so try not to drown your tattoo regularly in lotion. They like to breathe.</p>
      <p class="mb-8">- Over the next week or so your tattoo is going to scab. This is normal, so don't panic. Don't pick the scabs. They will fall off when they're good and ready!</p>

      <h3 class="text-h3 font-weight-bold">RULES:</h3>
      <p><strong>- NO SOAKING IN WATER FOR AT LEAST 2 WEEKS (when the tattoo should be completely healed). You can shower like normal with unscented or antibacterial soap. Just no soaking.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>- Try to avoid extended amounts of time in direct sunlight for 2 weeks.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>- While your tattoo is healing, it is still an open wound. Treat it as such. Clean clothes and clean sheets are crucial. If you expose your tattoo to unsanitary environments you will risk infection.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>- 2 weeks is the standard amount of time it takes for a tattoo to completely heal, but it could take a couple more before the tattoo is nice and settled into your skin.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>- If for some reason your tattoo heals up and has lost some pigment, during the healing process, please please give me a shout for a touch up. Touch up's are free! Your tattoo should look perfect so don't be afraid to ask!</strong></p>
