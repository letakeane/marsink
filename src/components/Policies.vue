      <p class="text-body-1 text-left mb-8">All deposits are non-refundable. This is because my time scheduling and drawing needs to be compensated.</p>
      <h4 class="text-h4">Cancellations</h4>
      <p class="text-body-1 text-left mb-2">Cancellations must be made at least 48 hours before your scheduled appointment. If a cancellation is made within 48 hours, a new appointment must be scheduled.</p>
      <p class="text-body-1 text-left mb-2">Upon no call no showing, your design may be forfeited and available to the public and will not be rescheduled.</p>
      <p class="text-body-1 text-left mb-2">Repeat cancellations on a single design will require a new deposit after the second rescheduling.</p>
      <p class="text-body-1 text-left mb-8">A legal form of ID is required for your appointment, and without one you must reschedule.</p>
      <h4 class="text-h4 text-left">Thank you so much in advance for understanding and working with me!</h4>
